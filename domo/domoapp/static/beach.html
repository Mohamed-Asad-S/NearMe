Marina Beach is India's longest and the world's second-longest urban beach, stretching 13 kilometers along the Bay of Bengal in Chennai. It is a popular destination for strolling, watching sunrises, and visiting memorials and statues, though it is not safe for swimming due to strong undercurrents. The beach serves as a cultural and social hub, hosting events, festivals, and street food stalls, and is considered a prominent landmark of the city        </p>
