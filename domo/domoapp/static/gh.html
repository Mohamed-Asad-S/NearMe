        A government hospital is a public healthcare institution funded and managed by the government, providing medical services to all citizens, often at low or no cost. These hospitals offer a wide range of services, from primary care like immunizations to specialized, secondary, and tertiary care, including emergency services, surgery, specialist consultations, and diagnostics. They serve as a crucial part of the public health system and often act as referral centers for smaller local clinics.
